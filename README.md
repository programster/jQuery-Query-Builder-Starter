jQuery Query Builder Starter
============================

A template/starter for getting [jQuery query builder](https://querybuilder.js.org/) running, because it's a bit of a faff.

This example simply gets the query builder set up, with a button that when clicked, 
fetches the rules and displays them in a textarea. In your project, you are likely
to want to change this to perform either a form submission, or an ajax request, with
the rules being translated by the backend into an SQL query.
